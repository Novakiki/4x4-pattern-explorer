# Welcome to Meta-Matrix

## What is this?

Meta-Matrix is a tool for understanding yourself through universal patterns - expressed in language that makes sense to you.

Whether you come from a Buddhist, scientific, Christian, Indigenous, or secular background, the way humans think follows patterns. This app helps you:

1. **Explore** 16 fundamental ways you process your world
2. **Recognize** patterns you already know, just named differently
3. **Practice** with beliefs that might be limiting you
4. **Discover** connections between different ways of being

Think of it as a map of human consciousness - but you get to choose which language the map uses.

## How to Use It

### Choose Your Lens

When you first open the app, pick the perspective that resonates with you:
- **Buddhist** - Mindfulness, compassion, non-attachment
- **Scientific** - Evidence, inquiry, systems thinking
- **Psychological** - Emotions, identity, development
- **LDS** - Covenant, gathering, revelation
- **Ecological** - Interconnection, cycles, symbiosis
- ...and 8 more

Don't worry - you can switch lenses anytime. The patterns stay the same; only the words change.

### Explore the Matrix

The matrix shows 16 fundamental cognitive operations:
- **OBSERVE** × OBSERVE = Witnessing (pure awareness)
- **OBSERVE** × ASK = Questioning (curiosity)
- **OBSERVE** × REMEMBER = Recognizing (seeing patterns)
- **OBSERVE** × IMAGINE = Envisioning (possibility)
- ...and 12 more

**Hover** over any cell to see it through your chosen lens.
**Click** to dive deeper and see it through all 13 lenses.

### Use the Boundary Card

This is where theory becomes practice.

When you find an operation that resonates (or challenges you), click "Enter Boundary Mode." You'll be guided through 8 steps to examine a belief:

1. **Name it** - What do you believe?
2. **Origins** - Where did this belief come from?
3. **Permeability** - Is it rigid, semi-permeable, or slippery?
4. **Function** - Is it serving you right now?
5. **Placement** - Is this at the edge or core of who you are?
6. **Experiment** - What small thing could you try?
7. **Presence** - Three breaths to integrate
8. **Review** - See your map, save or archive

The Boundary Card isn't about getting rid of beliefs - it's about understanding their role in your life and choosing whether to keep them where they are.

## Real Examples

### Example 1: The Rigid Belief
**Belief**: "I'm not creative"
**Origin**: Elementary school teacher's comment
**Permeability**: Rigid
**Function**: Gripping (holding me back)
**Placement**: Middle (not core, but influential)
**Experiment**: "I'll spend 10 minutes this week doodling, no judgment"

### Example 2: The Helpful Boundary
**Belief**: "I need 8 hours of sleep"
**Origin**: Personal experience
**Permeability**: Semi-permeable (flexible when needed)
**Function**: Serving (keeps me healthy)
**Placement**: Edge (practical guideline)
**Experiment**: "Keep it, no changes needed"

### Example 3: The Evolving Truth
**Belief**: "I should always say yes to help others"
**Origin**: Family values + burnout experience
**Permeability**: Becoming slippery (learning discernment)
**Function**: Mixed (helpful but exhausting)
**Placement**: Moving from core to edge
**Experiment**: "Practice saying 'I need to think about it' before committing"

## Who Is This For?

- **Seekers** exploring wisdom traditions
- **Therapists** looking for frameworks to share with clients
- **Teachers** helping students recognize thinking patterns
- **Anyone** working with limiting beliefs
- **Bridgers** who see connections between different worldviews

## What This Isn't

This is **not**:
- A replacement for therapy
- Religious indoctrination (any direction)
- A productivity hack
- A quick fix

This **is**:
- A contemplative tool
- A recognition system for patterns you already know
- A practice space for belief work
- An invitation to see familiar truths through new eyes

## Privacy & Your Data

Everything you enter in the Boundary Card stays on your device. We don't collect, store, or transmit your personal reflections. Your beliefs are yours.

## A Note from the Creator

This app emerged from my own need to find universal patterns beneath culturally-specific practices. As an ex-Mormon, I saw the wisdom in the 4x4 Plan but needed to liberate it from institutional framing.

What I discovered: the patterns work *because they're universal*, not because they belong to any one tradition. Buddhist practitioners know these operations. So do therapists, scientists, artists, and grandmothers.

This app is my gift to anyone who's ever felt trapped by language - who knew a truth was real but couldn't access it because the words didn't fit.

May you find yourself in these patterns.
