# Axes System Removal - Summary

## What Was Removed

The "axes" system was a layer of dualities/polarities (like "self ↔ other", "visible ↔ hidden") that sat between lenses and patterns. This added conceptual complexity without directly serving the core meta-verb matrix structure.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

1. **`src/components/PatternDetail.jsx`**
   - Removed all axis-related imports (`useAxisCatalog`, `AxisDetailModal`)
   - Removed "Dualities This Pattern Trains" section
   - Simplified to show only: Pattern description, 4×4 mapping, Why it matters, LDS example, Reflection question

2. **`src/data/lenses.json`**
   - Removed all `highlightAxes` fields from every lens
   - Each lens now only contains:
     - id, name, covenant, gather, veil, color, description
     - `highlightPatterns` (which patterns to emphasize)

### Files to Delete

Run the cleanup script to remove these files:

```bash
chmod +x remove-axes.sh
./remove-axes.sh
```

This will delete:
- `src/data/axes.json` (24 dualities)
- `src/hooks/useAxisCatalog.js` (hook for accessing axes)
- `src/components/AxisDetailModal.jsx` (modal for showing axis details)
- `src/components/AxisSelector.jsx` (dropdown for selecting axes)

## New Structure

### Before (4 layers):
```
Lenses (13) 
  ↓ emphasize
Axes (24 dualities)
  ↓ train
Patterns (12)
  ↓ reveal
Meta-Verb Matrix (16 operations)
```

### After (3 layers):
```
Lenses (13)
  ↓ highlight
Patterns (12)
  ↓ reveal
Meta-Verb Matrix (16 operations)
```

## Why This Is Better

1. **Clearer Mental Model**: Three clear layers instead of four
2. **Direct Connection**: Lenses directly highlight patterns that reveal the matrix
3. **Less Maintenance**: 24 fewer concepts to maintain and explain
4. **Focus on Core Discovery**: The axes were interesting but tangential to the main insight about the 16 cognitive operations

## What You Keep

✅ **13 Lenses** - Different perspectives on the framework
✅ **12 Patterns** - Why the framework is complete  
✅ **Meta-Verb Matrix** - The 16 fundamental cognitive operations
✅ **MM4 Integration** - How each operation maps to ward actions
✅ **Cross-Domain Examples** - How operations appear in therapy, art, science, etc.

## Testing Checklist

After running the cleanup script:

- [ ] Run `npm run dev`
- [ ] Visit homepage - should load without errors
- [ ] Switch between lenses - quote should transform
- [ ] Click patterns - should highlight based on selected lens
- [ ] View pattern details - should show full pattern info (no axis section)
- [ ] Click "Explore Meta-Matrix" - should show 16 operations
- [ ] Click any meta-matrix cell - should show operation details with MM4 example

## Commit Message

```
Remove axes system, simplify to lenses → patterns → meta-matrix

- Removed 24 axes dualities as unnecessary layer
- Simplified PatternDetail component
- Removed highlightAxes from all lenses
- Deleted: axes.json, useAxisCatalog, AxisDetailModal, AxisSelector
- Result: Clearer 3-layer structure focusing on core meta-verb discovery
```

## Notes

The axes were an attempt to add texture to each lens by naming specific polarities they emphasize. While intellectually interesting, they:
- Didn't directly map to the 4×4 matrix structure
- Added complexity without adding insight into the 16 operations
- Were tangential to the main discovery

The simpler structure keeps focus on what matters: **The 16 fundamental cognitive operations and how they combine to create completeness.**
