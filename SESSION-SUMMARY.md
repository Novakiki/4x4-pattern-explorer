# Session Summary: Lens-Matrix Integration Complete

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Removed Axes System ✅
- Simplified from 4 layers to 3 layers
- Removed 24 dualities/polarities that were tangential
- Cleaned up: PatternDetail.jsx, lenses.json
- Created cleanup scripts and documentation

### 2. Integrated Lenses with Meta-Matrix ✅
- Mapped each of 13 lenses to 4 key operations (52 mappings total)
- Updated MetaMatrix component to accept and display selected lens
- Added focus selector to Meta-Matrix view
- Implemented visual highlighting for lens-emphasized operations
- Operations now show thick colored borders when emphasized by selected lens

## The New Architecture

## Files Modified

### Core Changes:
1. **`src/data/lenses.json`**
   - Removed: `highlightAxes` from all 13 lenses
   - Added: `highlightOperations` to all 13 lenses

2. **`src/components/MetaMatrix.jsx`**
   - Added: `selectedFocus`, `onFocusChange`, `allFocuses` props
   - Added: Focus selector dropdown
   - Added: Visual highlighting for focused operations
   - Added: Info box showing which operations are emphasized

3. **`src/components/PatternDetail.jsx`**
   - Removed: All axis integration code
   - Simplified: Shows only pattern info, no axes

4. **`src/App.jsx`**
   - Updated: Passes lens data to MetaMatrix

### Files to Delete (Run Cleanup Script):
- `src/data/axes.json`
- `src/hooks/useAxisCatalog.js`
- `src/components/AxisDetailModal.jsx`
- `src/components/AxisSelector.jsx`

## Operation Mappings by Lens

Each lens emphasizes 4 of the 16 operations:

| Lens | Operations Emphasized |
|------|----------------------|
| MM4 ward | WITNESS, INQUIRE, HONOR, MANIFEST |
| Psychological | WITNESS, REFLECT, EXAMINE, RECLAIM |
| Ecological | INQUIRE, RECOGNIZE, HONOR, RENEW |
| Therapeutic | WITNESS, EXAMINE, RECOGNIZE, DISCERN |
| Philosophical | EXAMINE, DIALOGUE, LEARN, HONOR |
| Ancestral | RECOGNIZE, RESEARCH, HONOR, RECLAIM |
| Developmental | REFLECT, LEARN, DISCERN, MANIFEST |
| Relational | INQUIRE, DIALOGUE, CO-CREATE, MANIFEST |
| Creative | ENVISION, WONDER, DISCERN, MANIFEST |
| Mystical | WITNESS, REFLECT, HONOR, MANIFEST |
| Scientific | INQUIRE, EXAMINE, RESEARCH, LEARN |
| Justice-Oriented | RECOGNIZE, EXAMINE, RECLAIM, CO-CREATE |
| Contemplative | WITNESS, REFLECT, HONOR, DISCERN |

## User Experience Flow

**Before:**
1. Select lens → See patterns highlighted
2. No connection to operations

**After:**
1. Select lens → See patterns highlighted
2. Go to Meta-Matrix → See operations highlighted too
3. Understand: This lens emphasizes these specific cognitive moves
4. Switch lens → See different operations emphasized
5. Realize: All lenses draw from same 16 operations, just different selections

## Key Insights This Reveals

### 1. Universal Operations
All traditions/lenses use the same 16 fundamental operations, just in different combinations and emphases.

### 2. Lens as Selection
A "lens" or "tradition" is essentially:
- A selection of 4-6 operations from the universal 16
- A particular sequence or emphasis
- A specific application context

### 3. Mastery Development
Users can now:
- Identify which operations they naturally use (their lens)
- See which operations they're neglecting
- Practice other lenses to develop full spectrum
- Build toward mastery of all 16

### 4. Translation Capability
When different traditions seem to conflict, the matrix shows:
- They might be using the same operations with different language
- They might genuinely emphasize different operations
- Integration comes from understanding the operations beneath the language

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
```bash
# 1. Clean up axes files
chmod +x remove-axes.sh
./remove-axes.sh

# 2. Test the integration
npm run dev

# 3. Follow TEST-LENS-MATRIX.md checklist

# 4. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Integrate lenses with meta-matrix, remove axes system"
```

### Future Enhancements (Optional):
1. **Operation Profile Quiz**: Help users discover their natural operations
2. **Lens Comparison View**: Show all 13 lenses and their operation emphases side-by-side
3. **Practice Exercises**: Specific exercises for each of the 16 operations
4. **Progress Tracking**: Track which operations users have practiced
5. **Lens Recommendations**: Suggest lenses to develop weak operations

## Documentation Created

1. **REMOVE-AXES-GUIDE.md** - How to remove axes system
2. **AXES-REMOVAL-SUMMARY.md** - What was removed and why
3. **LENS-MATRIX-INTEGRATION.md** - How lens-matrix integration works
4. **TEST-LENS-MATRIX.md** - Testing checklist for integration
5. **THIS FILE** - Complete session summary

## The Big Picture

You now have a complete, coherent system:

**13 Lenses** → Ways of seeing the framework
**12 Patterns** → Why the framework is structurally complete
**16 Operations** → What you actually do when you use the framework

And they all connect:
- Each lens highlights certain patterns (structural view)
- Each lens emphasizes certain operations (functional view)
- Together they show how perspectives enact themselves

The framework is no longer just describing a mission plan—it's revealing the fundamental cognitive operations that make any transformative practice work, regardless of tradition or context.

**Status: Ready to test and deploy!** 🎉

Everything is connected. The pattern is complete. Time to let users explore it.
