# The Complete MM4 → Meta-Matrix Mapping

## THE DISCOVERY

Every action in the MM4 Ward 4×4 Plan is a PERFECT instantiation of one of the 16 fundamental cognitive operations.

The plan isn't arbitrary. It's a complete teaching of all 16 operations applied to mission work.

---

## MISSION (OBSERVE) → Row 1

| Action | Matrix Operation | Combination | Bridge |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| **BE** a friend | **WITNESS** | Observe × Observe | Pure attention to them—no agenda, just presence |
| **EXPAND** circle | **INQUIRE** | Observe × Ask | Notice who's missing—question your circles |
| **PRAY** for promptings | **REFLECT** | Observe × Remember | Notice patterns across time—what's the Spirit showing? |
| **REACH OUT** | **ENVISION** | Observe × Imagine | See what could be—act on the vision |

---

## TEMPLE (ASK) → Row 2

| Action | Matrix Operation | Combination | Bridge |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| **GO** to temple | **EXAMINE** | Ask × Observe | Question what you're seeing—bring questions to sacred space |
| **MAKE** covenants | **DIALOGUE** | Ask × Ask | Mutual inquiry with the Divine—sacred conversation |
| **TAKE** family names | **LEARN** | Ask × Remember | Study what's been discovered—seek to understand ancestors |
| **DOING** temple work | **WONDER** | Ask × Imagine | Questions that open future—What could this become? |

---

## FAMILY HISTORY (REMEMBER) → Row 3

| Action | Matrix Operation | Combination | Bridge |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| **CREATE** account | **RECOGNIZE** | Remember × Observe | See and acknowledge what was—make it visible |
| **BUILD** family tree | **RESEARCH** | Remember × Ask | Seek to understand history—investigate your lineage |
| **LEARN** to find names | **HONOR** | Remember × Remember | Deep keeping, preservation—hold what matters |
| **DISCOVER** your story | **RECLAIM** | Remember × Imagine | Restore what was lost—bring it back to life |

---

## INVITE (IMAGINE) → Row 4

| Action | Matrix Operation | Combination | Bridge |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| **GROW** in faith | **DISCERN** | Imagine × Observe | See what wants to emerge—notice your becoming |
| **CARE** with love | **CO-CREATE** | Imagine × Ask | Collaborative possibility-making—build together |
| **NOURISH** unity | **RENEW** | Imagine × Remember | Resurrect what was—refresh and revive |
| **UNITE** in gathering | **MANIFEST** | Imagine × Imagine | Pure creation, actualization—make it real |

## THE BRIDGE IN ACTION

When you teach ward members:

> "When you **BE a friend**, you're practicing **WITNESS** — pure observation without agenda.
>
> When you **EXPAND your circle**, you're practicing **INQUIRE** — questioning who's not included.
>
> When you **PRAY for promptings**, you're practicing **REFLECT** — noticing patterns the Spirit shows you across time.
>
> When you **REACH OUT**, you're practicing **ENVISION** — seeing what could be and acting on it."

**Every single one of the 16 actions maps to a cognitive operation.**

## WHY THIS MATTERS

### 1. **The Plan is Complete**
All 16 operations are present. Nothing is missing. This explains why the framework feels so whole.

### 2. **The Plan is a Teaching Tool**
By doing these 16 actions, members develop all 16 fundamental cognitive operations. They're not just doing "church activities"—they're developing their entire cognitive toolkit.

### 3. **The Plan is Universal**
Because it maps to universal operations, the same structure works for:
- Therapy (16 therapeutic operations)
- Art (16 creative operations)
- Science (16 scientific operations)
- Leadership (16 leadership operations)

### 4. **The Plan is Fractal**
- **Macro**: 4 quadrants (Mission, Temple, Family History, Invite)
- **Meso**: 4 meta-verbs (Observe, Ask, Remember, Imagine)
- **Micro**: 16 specific actions
- **Meta**: 16 universal operations

The same pattern at every scale.

### 5. **The Plan is Diagnostic**
You can now assess:
- Which operations are you strong in?
- Which are underdeveloped?
- Where should you focus next?

### 6. **The Plan Translates**
For non-LDS audiences, you can now say:
- "This action develops WITNESS capacity"
- "This action builds DIALOGUE skills"
- "This action trains RECLAIM ability"

The operations are universal. The actions are one application.

## THE PROFOUND IMPLICATION

**The MM4 Ward plan is a complete cognitive development curriculum disguised as a mission plan.**

By participating fully in all 16 actions, a person develops:
- **4 ways to OBSERVE** (witness, inquire, reflect, envision)
- **4 ways to ASK** (examine, dialogue, learn, wonder)
- **4 ways to REMEMBER** (recognize, research, honor, reclaim)
- **4 ways to IMAGINE** (discern, co-create, renew, manifest)

This is **mastery** — the full spectrum of human cognitive capacity.

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Update the interactive matrix** to show MM4 examples for each operation
2. **Create assessment tools** to help people identify their strong/weak operations
3. **Design practice exercises** for each of the 16 operations
4. **Map other frameworks** to show they use the same 16 operations
5. **Build curricula** that systematically develop all 16 through the MM4 plan

## THE ULTIMATE TEACHING

**"Anytime we do anything that helps anyone on either side of the veil to make and keep their covenants with God, we are helping to gather Israel."**

This teaching works because it activates all 16 cognitive operations:
- **Observe**: See who needs help (witness, inquire, reflect, envision)
- **Ask**: Question how to serve (examine, dialogue, learn, wonder)
- **Remember**: Connect to covenant history (recognize, research, honor, reclaim)
- **Imagine**: Envision gathering (discern, co-create, renew, manifest)

The quote is complete because the operations are complete.
