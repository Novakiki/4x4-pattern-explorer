      "whyItMatters": "When we only focus on the urgent present, we lose context and vision. This framework ensures you're connected to all of time—rooted in the past, present in this moment, asking eternal questions, and envisioning the future.",
      "reflection": "Which dimension of time do you naturally gravitate toward? Which do you avoid?",
      "ldsExample": "Mission work (present), temple worship (eternal), family history (past), gathering Israel (future)"

      "whyItMatters": "Integration requires bridging apparent opposites—transcendent and grounded, past and future. This framework literally enacts that integration through its structure.",
      "reflection": "Do you tend to live more on the horizontal axis (time-focused) or vertical axis (dimension-focused)? What would balance look like?",
      "ldsExample": "Heaven and earth, past and future—the cross pattern appears in temple architecture and covenant theology"

        "imagine": "Dissolving boundaries (integration and wholeness)"
      },
      "whyItMatters": "Every meaningful framework must bridge different states of being—present and absent, known and unknown, visible and invisible. This pattern ensures you're not stuck on just one side.",
      "reflection": "What boundary are you working with right now? Which of the four positions feels most needed?",
      "ldsExample": "Working with the living, temple as threshold, reaching to ancestors across the veil, gathering toward unity"

        "imagine": "Contemplative projection (envisioning, allowing emergence)"
      },
      "whyItMatters": "All action with no contemplation leads to exhaustion. All contemplation with no action leads to stagnation. This framework builds rest into the cycle.",
      "reflection": "Are you more naturally action-oriented or contemplation-oriented? What would balance feel like?",
      "ldsExample": "Missionary work (active), temple worship (contemplative), family history work (active), prayerful planning (contemplative)"

      },
      "whyItMatters": "Jung argued that psychological wholeness requires developing all four functions. Most people have one or two that dominate. This framework ensures you're touching all four, even if some feel uncomfortable.",
      "reflection": "Which function is your 'home base'? Which one challenges you most?",
      "ldsExample": "Serving others (sensation), seeking answers in temple (thinking), connecting with ancestors (feeling), envisioning gathering (intuition)"

      },
      "whyItMatters": "This is how therapy works. How education works. How scientific discovery works. How spiritual awakening works. The framework isn't prescribing anything artificial—it's describing the natural cycle of human development.",
      "reflection": "Where are you in this cycle right now with your biggest current challenge?",
      "ldsExample": "Notice a neighbor's need → ask in prayer → remember similar situations → imagine how to help → observe the outcome"

      "whyItMatters": "The framework literally breathes. It's rhythmic, cyclical, life-giving. You can't rush it. You can't skip steps. It moves at the pace of life itself.",
      "reflection": "Can you feel the breath rhythm in your practice? What phase are you in right now?",
      "ldsExample": "Receive from missionary work, pause in temple worship, release through family history service, rest before beginning again"

        "cosmic": "All time: current moment → eternal questions → honoring what came before → vision of ultimate wholeness"
      },
      "whyItMatters": "Because it's fractal, you can practice this at any scale. You don't need to 'do big things.' The pattern works in a 5-minute interaction just as well as in a 40-year life arc.",
      "reflection": "What's the smallest scale where you could practice this today?",
      "ldsExample": "From a single conversation to an entire dispensation—the pattern of observe, ask, remember, imagine repeats at every level"

        "imagine": "Theory (propose what could be, test predictions)"
      },
      "whyItMatters": "The framework isn't 'religious vs. scientific.' It's how consciousness itself works. Science and spirituality use the same underlying pattern because it's the pattern of discovery itself.",
      "reflection": "Have you been taught that faith and inquiry oppose each other? What if they're the same motion?",
      "ldsExample": "Notice a need, pray for guidance, study the scriptures and family records, envision how to move forward"

      "whyItMatters": "Neither receptive nor active energy is privileged. Both are essential. The framework won't work if you only do half. You need to receive AND initiate, rest AND act.",
      "reflection": "Which energy feels more natural to you? What would it mean to honor both?",
      "ldsExample": "Receive in missionary work, initiate in temple worship, receive from ancestors, initiate in gathering"
